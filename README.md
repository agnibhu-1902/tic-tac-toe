# tic-tac-toe
Play tic-tac-toe with the computer.

This is a recreation of the classic game we all know and love. The computer opponent (a.k.a. Vanessa) is smart enough to understand your moves and take appropriate decisions, and sometimes she might make random choices. This has been made possible using the following files:

**brain.cpp:** This file contains code using which Vanessa will try to win the game or prevent you from winning.

**randomize.cpp:** This file contains code using which Vanessa will make random choices regarding where to place her moves.

Vanessa's AI will alternate between brain.cpp and randomize.cpp in a 4:1 ratio in order to make the game atmosphere more lively.
